# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Overview

The Prime Game is a two-player turn-based game where Maria and Ben take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to n. Each chosen prime number and its multiples are removed from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played for multiple rounds, each with a different value of n, and the goal is to determine the overall winner based on optimal play strategies. Maria always starts first.
