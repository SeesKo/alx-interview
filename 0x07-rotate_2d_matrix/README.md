# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves implementing an algorithm to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place. The challenge is to perform the rotation without using extra space, thereby directly modifying the input matrix.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.10
