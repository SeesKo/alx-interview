# 0x05. N Queens

The N Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The classic algorithmic approach to solving this problem is backtracking.

## Concepts and Resources

### 1. Backtracking Algorithms
**Understanding Backtracking:**  
Backtracking is a method of solving problems by exploring all potential solutions and abandoning them (backtracking) as soon as it determines that they cannot lead to a valid solution.

### 2. Recursion
**Understanding Recursion:**  
Recursion involves functions calling themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

### 3. List Manipulations in Python
**Understanding Lists:**  
Lists are used to store the positions of the queens on the board.

### 4. Python Command Line Arguments
**Handling Command-Line Arguments:**  
Using the `sys` module to handle command-line arguments.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- `python3` (version 3.4.3).
- Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7).
- All files must be executable.
